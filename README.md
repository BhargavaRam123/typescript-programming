# TypeScript Programming

This repository showcases comprehensive TypeScript implementations focusing on object-oriented programming principles, type safety, and enterprise-level development practices. Each implementation demonstrates industry-standard coding practices and modern TypeScript features for building scalable, maintainable applications.

## Core TypeScript Fundamentals

### Advanced Type System
Comprehensive exploration of TypeScript's powerful type system including primitive types, union types, intersection types, literal types, and conditional types. Demonstrates type guards, type assertions, and advanced type manipulation techniques for building type-safe applications with compile-time error detection.

### Object-Oriented Programming with TypeScript
Complete implementation of OOP principles using TypeScript's enhanced syntax including class declarations, inheritance hierarchies, abstract classes, and polymorphism. Showcases how TypeScript's type system enhances traditional OOP patterns with compile-time safety and better IDE support.

### Class Architecture & Design Patterns
Advanced class implementations demonstrating encapsulation, inheritance, and composition patterns. Includes examples of singleton pattern, factory pattern, observer pattern, and other design patterns implemented with TypeScript's type safety and modern syntax features.

### Interface Design & Implementation
Comprehensive interface definitions for contracts, data models, and API specifications. Demonstrates interface inheritance, optional properties, readonly properties, index signatures, and function type interfaces for creating robust type contracts in large applications.

### Access Modifiers & Encapsulation
Professional implementation of access control using public, private, protected, and readonly modifiers. Includes examples of data hiding, controlled access patterns, and creating secure object interfaces that prevent unauthorized access to internal state.

## Advanced TypeScript Features

### Decorator Pattern Implementation
Modern decorator usage for cross-cutting concerns including method decorators, class decorators, property decorators, and parameter decorators. Demonstrates metadata reflection, aspect-oriented programming, and dependency injection patterns using TypeScript's experimental decorator support.

### Generic Programming
Advanced generic implementations including generic classes, generic functions, generic constraints, and conditional types. Showcases type parameter manipulation, mapped types, and utility types for creating reusable, type-safe components and libraries.

### Module System & Namespace Management
Enterprise-level module organization using ES6 modules, namespaces, and barrel exports. Demonstrates proper code organization, dependency management, and creating scalable application architectures with clear separation of concerns.

## Enterprise Development Practices

### Exception Handling Architecture
Robust error handling strategies including custom error classes, error hierarchies, and centralized error management. Implements try-catch patterns, async error handling, and error propagation strategies for building resilient applications with proper error recovery mechanisms.

### Logging Infrastructure
Professional logging implementation using structured logging, log levels, and logging frameworks. Demonstrates correlation IDs, contextual logging, and integration with monitoring systems for production-ready applications with comprehensive observability.

### File I/O Operations
Comprehensive file system operations including synchronous and asynchronous file handling, stream processing, and file manipulation utilities. Implements proper resource management, error handling, and performance optimization techniques for file-based operations.

### Configuration Management
Enterprise configuration handling including environment-based configuration, type-safe configuration objects, and validation patterns. Demonstrates configuration injection, default value handling, and runtime configuration validation for deployment flexibility.
